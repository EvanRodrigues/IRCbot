# IRC Bot

An IRC Bot designed for a twitch.tv chatroom.

## Development

The bot is written purely in python. I originally used mIRC Scripting Language to develop this project, but I decided that it would be better to use python. I chose python because it was a language that I had experience with, and I needed to practice it more. Also, MSL is not a very powerful language compared to python. There is not a lot of documentation out there, and hardly any one uses it.

## Features

-   Rewards and keeps track of loyalty points
-   Raffles
-   Games
-   Quote system
-   Song request list management
-   Custom commands

## What I Learned

-   Multithreading
-   Python syntax
-   PIP

## Future Plans

-   Detect when stream is offline to avoid giving points when there is nothing to watch.
-   Design the bot for more general use instead of being specific to me.
-   Set up a webhook for new followers.
