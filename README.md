# IRC Bot

An IRC Bot designed for a twitch.tv chatroom.

## Development

The bot is written purely in python. Originally it was developed using the mIRC Scripting Language, but eventually I decided to migrate to python. I chose python because it was a language that I had experience with but needed to practice more. Also, MSL was not a language I enjoyed working with. There is not a lot of documentation out there and the language was very limited.

## Features

**NOTE: Most features are being reworked and will be added in the coming weeks**

-   Raffles (Being reworked)
-   Games (Being reworked)
-   Quote system (Being reworked)
-   Song request list management (Being reworked)
-   Can fetch world record speedrun information
-   Custom commands

## What I Learned

-   Multithreading
-   Lambda functions
-   Digesting data from the speedrun.com and haloruns.com APIs
-   PIP

## Future Plans

-   Rework old features.
-   Use Twitch's built in channel points when 3rd party management becomes available.
-   Simplify the bot and start fresh using more 3rd party tools and APIs.
-   Set up a webhook for new followers.
-   Design the bot for more general use instead of being specific to me.
